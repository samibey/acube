* What qualifies as a disability that requires ?accommodation?
According to the legal definition provided in Section 504 of the U.S. 1973 Rehabilitation Act, an “individual with a disability" is any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Providing accommodations equalizes the opportunity for a student with a disability to participate in the program or activity. The Accessible Education Office will also work with students who have temporary impairments— such as broken limbs and concussions—that may affect them for limited periods of time.
* Are accommodations a privilege or a right?
AUB participates in federal funding from the U.S. and therefore is required by the Office of Civil Rights and U.S. Department of Education legislation to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. In addition, AUB's own non-discrimination policy is in place to ensure that no student is discriminated against on the basis of disability and has meaningful access to all programs, services, and activities. Therefore, accommodations are a right, not a privilege.
* When can I apply ?for accommodations?
For new students, students seeking accommodations must contact the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and set up an appointment to discuss their needs and how to submit their papers, this is usually done within the first month of the semester.
For Continuing students who would like to req?uest renewal of accommodations must do so early every semester (check with the AEO regarding the deadline), this also shall be done within the first semester.
Exceptions after the deadline are studied case by case.
* Where is the Accessible Education Office located?
The Accessible Education Office is located in the Office of Student Affairs, West Hall, 3rd floor, Room 304. Further contact details can be found on the AEO website
* What are the requirements to apply for accommodations?
For new students, the process includes filling in three forms: Student support form, Professors’ form, Form A/B. Student support form and professors’ form shall be filled in by the student while Form A/B shall be filled in by the treating physician.
For continuing students, they have to only provide the professor’s form to renew their accommodations for the semester.
* What are the forms?
Students support request form, a form that includes relevant personal information. 
Professors form, a form which provides us with information about whom should receive your accommodations letter.
Form A is for physical disabilities or impairments, and Form B which is for psychological learning difficulties.
* What documents do I need in order to receive accommodations?
Please check the documentation guidelines.
* What are the accommodations offered?
Accommodations are anything that mitigates the effects of a person's disability and removes a barrier to full participation. For example, a person with dyslexia cannot gain access to the same textual information as their peers without extended time to read. Giving a student with dyslexia extended time to complete reading is a reasonable accommodation to break down that particular barrier to participation. Other examples of academic accommodations include, but not limited to, providing notes or a note taker, use of a computer, and testing in a separate location.
Those accommodations are determined as per your treating professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, etc…) recommendations.
* Does the accommodation letter apply for all my semesters at AUB?
The letter of ?accommodations should be renewed every semester. Please schedule an appointment with the AEO office in order to discuss renewal and requirements (if any).
* When do I need to renew my form B?
This is dependent on the diagnosis, kindly email the accessibility office to ask if you need to renew your form B. 
* I think I may have a disability, but I was never previously tested. What should I do?
If you think you may have an undiagnosed disability, please schedule an appointment with the AEO office in order to receive guidance or a specific referral.
* Do I need to send the accommodations to my professors?
No, but you need to remind the professors of your accommodations before exams.
* Do my accommodations appear on my transcript?
No, your case is confidential and shall not be disclosed.          


* If I give the whole class extra time to complete an exam, doesn't that fulfill the needs of a student with extended time as an accommodation?
No, extended time is relative to the actual amount of time the rest of the class received. So, if you are administering an hour-long exam but you end up giving the class two hours to complete it, a student in your class entitled to 50% extended time would be allowed a total of three hours for the same exam. 
* My student claims to have a disability, but to me, he/she doesn't seem disabled at all. Does he/she really need accommodations?
Many disabilities such as learning disabilities, ADHD, or mental health conditions are not visible or readily apparent to an outside observer. All students who are requesting reasonable accommodations for a disability are required to submit documentation (a formal assessment by a relevant professional) that shows the impact of their disability on their learning. Check out this website for more information about hidd?en or invisible disabilities.
* What if I believe an accommodation listed in the Letter of Accommodations alters an essential element of my course?
Do I have any recourse if I disagree with any of the recommended accommodations? Yes, in these instances, you are encouraged to bring your concerns to the Accessible Education Office for discussion. It may be that a different accommodation would be better suited to your particular course and the AEO can help develop an alternative with which you agree.
* What if I have a large class and I don't have the time to accommodate all these students?
If you plan your course with accommodations in mind, you will find it easier and less disruptive to implement them throughout the semester. By being creative and working collaboratively within departments, the resources and personnel necessary to meet student needs will become more apparent. Accessibility is the shared responsibility of the whole AUB community, so each person does not have to figure it out on their own. The Accessible Education Office is available to provide support and ideas as needed. See more on Universal Design Instruction here.?
* Why do students with the same disability have different accommodations?
Shouldn't they need the same things? Students with the same disability label can vary greatly in their abilities and needs for accommodation. One student may benefit from a certain accommodation while another may not. For example, one person with ADHD may not need a separate space to take an exam, whereas another might. This variation could be due to differences in the student's skills, abilities, and coping strategies, as well as other factors such as the severity of the disability, the course content, and the learning environment. That is why the AUB Letter of Accommodations is highly individualized, taking into account the specific needs of each student.
* I have a student who is struggling in my class. What should I do to help him/her?
Talk privately with the student to discuss your observations and refer him/her to the various supports offered at AUB. If the student needs more learning supports or reveals that he/she has a disability, refer him/her to the Accessible Education Office. If he/she is not aware of any particular difficulties, he/she may still be referred to the AEO for an intake appointment. If the student reveals mental health issues or personal crises, refer him/her to the Counseling Center. The AEO and the Counseling Center work closely together, so as long as the student makes it to either entity, he/she will get connected with the appropriate supports.
* Why doesn't the AUB Letter of Accommodations tell me what disability my student has?
Due to confidentiality practices, it is left solely up to the student if he or she wants to share their particular disability label or diagnosis. The Letter of Accommodation is developed after the disability has been confirmed through specialized professionals and thorough documentation; therefore, the accommodations listed are based on the particular needs of that student.
* What if students are just trying to “take advantage of the system" to get accommodations even if they don't need them?
Given our requirements for proper documentation and a clear procedure through which students obtain accommodations, students who just want to “take advantage" will have a very hard time doing so. At the same time of course, no system is completely flawless. AUB is of the opinion that, while there is the risk of an occasional person trying to “take advantage of the system," it is our duty to serve those in the community who truly need accommodations.
* How do you know you're not accommodating beyond what the student needs and making it too easy for them to succeed?
The accommodations process is dynamic and requires collaboration from all involved. While accommodations are recommended by specialized professionals in the field, it is not until the student is going through and actually making use of those accommodations that we can see whether or not they are too much or not enough. In addition, a student's needs may change over time depending on the nature of their disability. Because of this, we rely heavily on monitoring the student's progress and performance as well as hearing from the student. The AEO encourages students to be reflective and self-aware and follows up on all cases to see if accommodations need to be adjusted in any way. Adjustment of accommodations can be initiated by the student or professor. It is most common that students with disabilities are highly motivated to only use those accommodations that they actually need and are quick to say when they feel they do not need an accommodation.
* Don't most people get diagnosed with disabilities when they are young?
Why is this student just finding out? In some cases, it may be that the student has had the disability since childhood (e.g., dyslexia), but their needs have changed over time or their documentation is outdated. Other disabilities (e.g., neurological or mental health conditions) develop in early adulthood. It is not uncommon for high-performing students to be identified with a learning disability at the college level. Often, the compensatory strategies used at the secondary level are no longer adequate for the rigors of college. In addition, the anxieties and stressors that come with transitioning to college can exacerbate an already existing problem.
